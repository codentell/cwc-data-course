## Instructions

Use the following instructions to write commands in your terminal:

* Create a folder called `LearnPython`.

* Navigate into the folder.

* Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment1`.

* Inside `Assignment1`, create a file called `quick_python.py`.

* Add a print statement to `quick_python.py`.

* Run `quick_python.py`.

* Return to the `LearnPython` folder.

* Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment2`.

* Inside `Assignment2`, create a file called `quick_python2.py`.

* Add a different print statement to `quick_python2.py`.
