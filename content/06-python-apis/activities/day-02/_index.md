# 6.2:  Working with Weather and City APIs

## Overview

In today’s class, we’ll introduce a variety of new APIs while also covering exception handling and the use of Pandas with API responses.

## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Create applications from scratch by using nothing but their knowledge of Python and an API’s documentation.

* Load JSON from API responses into a Pandas DataFrame.

* Use `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors.
