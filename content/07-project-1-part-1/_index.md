* Begin research of datasets.
* Submit a project proposal for approval.
#### Day 2 & 3
* Develop your project with your team.

#### Day 4
* Develop your project with your team.
#### Day 5 
* Develop your project with your team and prepare your presentation.
#### Day 6
* Present your project to the class.

### Presentation Requirements
You will prepare a formal 10-minute presentation that covers the following topics:

* Questions that you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
* Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
* The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)
* Your conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary
* The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

## Development Requirements
Instructions: 
* Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets.
* Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
* Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data
(ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for
inclusion in your presentation.
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question”
that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.

## Bonus 
* Use at least one API—if you can find one with data pertinent to your primary research questions.



## Suggestions for Data Sources
Feel free to ask the instructional staff for input, but our general advice is to stick
to data sources that meet the following criteria:
* They are sufficiently large.
* They have a consistent format.
* They, ideally, contain more data than needed.
* They are well documented.
