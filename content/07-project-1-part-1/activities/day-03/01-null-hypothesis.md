# Forming a Null Hypothesis

In this activity, you will turn two questions into a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis.

## Instructions

Form a hypothesis and null hypothesis for the following questions:

1. Does dark chocolate affect arterial function in healthy individuals?

2. Does coffee have anti-aging properties?

- - -

##  Solutions
### Null Hypothesis

* Does dark chocolate improve arterial function in healthy individuals?

  * Alternate hypothesis - If dark chocolate is related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate over a one-year period will result in improved arterial function.

  * Null Hypothesis - If dark chocolate is not related to arterial function in healthy individuals, then consuming 30g of dark chocolate over a one-year period will show no improvement in arterial function.

* Does coffee have anti-aging properties?

  * Alternate hypothesis - If coffee consumption is related to anti-aging properties, then consuming 400 mg of coffee daily will reduce mortality from age related disease such as heart disease.

  * Null Hypothesis - If coffee consumption is not related to anti-aging properties, then consuming 400 mg of coffee daily will not show a reduction in age related disease such as heart disease.
