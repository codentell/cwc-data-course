# Degrees That Pay

You will now build on everything you have learned today to create a story in Tableau that visualizes what major and level of education “pays off” the most over time.

## Instructions

* Create a story using the datasets provided, and formulate graphs that might be used to explore the following questions:

* "Do engineering majors earn higher salaries than other majors?"

* "Is attending grad school associated with higher pay?"

* "Do higher salaries lead to higher or lower unemployment rates?"

    **Note:** You do not have to join any of the data for this activity. The worksheets that you will be creating do not require you to join the datasets in Tableau.

## Bonus

Create a chart that visualizes median and 75th percentile salaries, by major, split between graduate and non-graduate degrees.
