# Movie Rental Groups and Sets

* In this activity, you will use groups and sets to explore movie rentals at a fictitious rental shop.

## Instructions

* Import the xlsx file from the Resources folder.

* Drag the “rentals” sheet into the area labeled “Drag tables here.”

* Group the “Rented Days” field into Short, Medium, and Long rentals.

  * In the “Short” group, put any rental shorter than 3 days.

  * In the “Medium” group, put any rental from 3 days to 7 days.

  * In the “Long” group, put any rental longer than 7 days.

  * Create a chart comparing the Rented Days groups by average Paid Fee.

* Create a set for kids movies.

  * The kids movies set should have all movies rated G and PG as “In” and the other ratings as “Out.”

  * Rename the aliases for the set to “Kids Movies” and “Other.”

  * Create a chart comparing the total number of rentals between kids movies and other movies.

  * Create a chart comparing the average fees paid between kids movies and other movies.

  * Create a chart comparing the average rental duration between kids movies and other movies.

* Think of other ways to use groups and sets, and make some interesting visualizations!

* What conclusions can you draw?

## Bonus

* If you finish early, go back to earlier data sets, and try to create visualizations using groups or sets.
