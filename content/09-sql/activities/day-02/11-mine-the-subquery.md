# Mine the Subqueries

In this activity, you will continue to practice subqueries. Work individually or in pairs. You can use the [ERD](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/) for help with the queries.

## Instructions

* Using subqueries, identify all actors who appear in the film ALTER VICTORY in the `pagila` database.

* Using subqueries, display the titles of films that the employee Jon Stephens rented to customers.
