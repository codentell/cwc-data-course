# Movies Ordered By

In this activity, you will use `ORDER BY` in combination with other SQL methods to query and order the tables.

## Instructions

* Determine the count of actor first names with the names ordered in descending order.

* Determine the average rental duration for each rating rounded to two decimals. Order these in ascending order.

* Determine the top 10 average replacement costs for movies, ordered by their length.

## Bonus

Using the city and country tables, determine the count of countries in descending order.

FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY "avg duration";

-- Select top ten replace costs for the length of the movie

FROM film
GROUP BY length
ORDER BY "avg cost" DESC
LIMIT 10;
