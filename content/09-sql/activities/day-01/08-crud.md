# Using CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete

In this activity, you will use CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the provided data.

## Instructions

1. Create a new database named `Malaysia` in pgAdmin.

2. Create two new tables in the `Malaysia` database by copying the code provided in `schema.sql` into a new query window in pgAdmin.

3. Using the Import/Export tool, import the data from `mys_road_accidents.csv` into the `road_accidents` table, and then import the data from `mys_accidents_by_state.csv` into the `accidents_by_state` table.

4. In the `road_accidents` table, find the row that has a `road_crashes` value of 0 and note:

  * the year

  * the number of `road_deaths`

  * the names of the other two columns have missing data (0 values)

You will be able to calculate this missing data from the second table.

5. In the `accidents_by_state` table, delete all rows for years that do not have data missing from the `road_accidents` table.

6. In the `accidents_by_state` table, in a single SQL query, find the [Sum](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_count_avg_sum.asp) of each of the three columns with missing data, as well as `road_deaths`, and rename the summed columns with their original column name using `AS`.

    * **Hint:** If you don‚Äôt rename the columns, the columns will have a name like `sum(road_deaths)`.

Compare the sum of `road_deaths` from these results with the value from the `road_accidents` table. If they do not match, the other values will also be incorrect.

7. Once the `road_deaths` values match up, note the values for the three columns with missing data, and update the `road_accidents` table with this new information.

## Bonus

* Delete all rows from `accidents_by_state` and re-import the data from `mys_accidents_by_state.csv`. If you import the data again without deleting the rows, you will have duplicated data.

* Without deleting any rows, calculate the sum of `road_crashes`, `road_deaths`, `serious_injury`, and `slight_injury` for a subsequent year, and add those values plus the year to the `road_accidents` table.

    **Note**: You will need to also include a value for `_id` as it has been designated the Primary Key and cannot be null, nor can it be a duplicate value of `_id`.

```sql
-- Find row with missing data
SELECT * FROM road_accidents WHERE road_crashes = 0;

-- Note columns with missing data: road_crashes, serious_injury, slight_injury
-- Note year = 2017
-- Note road_deaths = 6740

-- Delete rows
DELETE FROM accidents_by_state
WHERE year != 2017;

-- Calculate the missing data and rename columns
SELECT SUM(road_crashes) AS road_crashes,
	SUM(serious_injury) AS serious_injury,
	SUM(slight_injury) AS slight_injury,
	SUM(road_deaths) AS road_deaths
FROM accidents_by_state;

-- Make note of them
-- road_crashes = 533875,
-- serious_injury = 3310,
-- slight_injury = 6539
-- road_deaths = 6740

-- Update missing data
UPDATE road_accidents
SET road_crashes = 533875,
	serious_injury = 3310,
	slight_injury = 6539
WHERE Year = 2017;

-- View table
SELECT * FROM road_accidents;

-- BONUS

-- Delete all rows
DELETE FROM accidents_by_state;

-- Remember to re-import from mys_accidents_by_state.csv

-- Calculate the data for year 2018
SELECT SUM(road_crashes) AS road_crashes,
	SUM(road_deaths) AS road_deaths,
	SUM(serious_injury) AS serious_injury,
	SUM(slight_injury) AS slight_injury
FROM accidents_by_state
WHERE year = 2018;

-- Insert new row
INSERT INTO 
road_accidents (_id, year, road_crashes, road_deaths, serious_injury, slight_injury)
VALUES (22, 2018, 548598,6284,2964,5377);

-- View table
SELECT * FROM road_accidents;
