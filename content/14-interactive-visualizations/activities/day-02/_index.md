### Overview

This lesson introduces the students to JavaScript methods that will help them organize and prepare data for charts in Plotly. As we've seen, data often needs to be prepared before it can be visualized. Here we will take advantage of some of the functional programming tools provided in JavaScript to prepare our data. Functional programming is used in many languages, and JavaScript provides a gentle introduction.

### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Apply the `map()` method and filter to parse data.

* Create and use arrow functions to simplify code.

* Use the `filter()` and arrow functions to manipulate and filter datasets.

* Use ES6 JavaScript methods.
