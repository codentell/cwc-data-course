# Movie Profit Looping

In this activity, you will create a for loop, append values into arrays based on a movie's decade, calculate the average profit of all movies, and print out how many of the top 10 movies came from each decade.

## Instructions

Given a list of movie objects in `data.js`, do the following:

* Open the starter file movies.js to edit.

* Append the movies into arrays based on the movie's decade.

* Calculate the average profit of all movies.

* Print how many of the top 10 movies came from each decade.

* Review your results in the DevTools console after opening `index.html` in Chrome.

## Hint

* For more information about how to push elements to an empty array, review 02-Ins_JavaScript-Variables_and_Data_Structures.

*  To find the length of the array, review the [JavaScript Array documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length) from Mozilla.
