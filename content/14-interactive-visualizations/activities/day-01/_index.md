### Overview

This class introduces the students to basic JavaScript through the creation of basic charts by using Plotly. By adding interactivity to otherwise static information, we allow users to discover and explore data in new ways. JavaScript is an important language to learn because it was developed specifically for the creation of interactive elements. JavaScript visualizations are easy to create and share with large audiences.


### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Describe JavaScript variables, arrays, data types, and statements.

* Implement basic JavaScript control flow (functions, loops, if/else statements).

* Create functions in JavaScript.

* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.

* Create basic charts, including bar charts and line charts, by using Plotly.

* Use Plotly's layout object to customize the appearance of charts.

* Annotate charts with labels, text, and hover text.
