### Overview

This lesson introduces the students to DOM selection, manipulation, and events using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). This information enables the students to add custom interactivity to their web visualizations. D3.js is an industry-standard data visualization library written in JavaScript.

### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Create charts by using data from API calls.

* Use D3 for basic document object model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.

* Apply the `this` keyword to reference elements within a function.

* Dynamically manipulate the DOM through events.

* Manipulate charts through dropdown events and click events.
