### Overview

In today’s lesson, the students will continue learning how to write regular expressions to find patterns in string data. They’ll then apply what they’ve learned to transforming and cleaning data by using regular expressions in an in-class ETL mini project.

### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

* Use wildcards, sets, and escape characters in regular expressions to extract information.

* Use special characters in regular expressions to extract information.

* Create and use capture groups in regular expressions to extract information.

* Continue working on the ETL mini project.

### Instructor Notes

Today's lesson will continue covering the use of regular expressions to find patterns in string data. The students will continue to work on their ETL mini project.

There will be more time for the students to work on the project in the next class. If any students don't finish the ETL mini project in class, they’ll need to finish it outside of class.

The TAs should be ready to help any students who become confused with either using regular expressions or the ETL mini project.

Lastly, as a reminder, these slideshows are for instructor use only; when distributing slides to students, please first export the slides to a PDF file. You may then send out the PDF file.
