###  Notes

The objective of today's class is to perform more advanced web scraping by using Splinter alongside Beautiful Soup to automate the scraping process.

You will also lead activities that are intended to prepare students for success in this week's challenge.

Since students will now be scraping actual websites, rather than HTML that has been copied into Jupyter notebooks, you'll also address the ethics and legality of web scraping.

Note that the legality of web scraping continues to be debated as new legal cases set new precedents. In preparation for today's lesson, search online to see if there have been any recent cases or decisions related to web scraping.
