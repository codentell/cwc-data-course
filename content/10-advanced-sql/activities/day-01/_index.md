## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Connect to a SQL database by using SQLAlchemy.

* Perform basic SQL queries by using `engine.execute()`.

* Create Python classes and objects.

* Create, read, update, and delete data from a SQL database by using SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapper (ORM).
