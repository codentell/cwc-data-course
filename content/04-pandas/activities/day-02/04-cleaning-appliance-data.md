# Hong Kong LPG Appliances

In this activity, you will take an LPG appliance dataset from Hong Kong, and clean it up so that the DataFrame is consistent and does not have any rows with missing data.

## Instructions

* Read in the CSV using Pandas, and print out the DataFrame that is returned.

  * **Note:** This dataset uses Chinese characters and should be read in using UTF-8 encoding.

* Reduce the DataFrame to only the columns in English.

* Get a count of the rows within the DataFrame to determine if there are any null values.

* Drop the rows that contain null values.

* Search through the "Applicant" column, and replace any similar values with one consistent value.

* Create a couple DataFrames that look into one Place of Manufacture only, and print them to the screen.
