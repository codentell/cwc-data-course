```python

# Running the basic "Hello World" code
hello = "Hello World"
print(hello)
Hello World

# Doing simple math
4 + 4
8

# Storing results in variables
a = 5

# Using those variables elsewhere in the code
a
5


# Variables will hold the value most recently run
# This means that, if we run the code above, it will now print 2
a = 2
