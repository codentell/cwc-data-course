# 4.3 Merging and Data Cleaning

## Overview

Today's lesson is split into two parts. The first part will test the Pandas skills of the class by having them identify and fix buggy code so it functions properly. In the second part, the students will use all the tools they have developed this week to understand the concept of programmatically manipulating data.

## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Merge DataFrames and distinguish between inner, outer, left, and right merges.

* Slice data by using the `cut()` method, and create new values based on a series of bins.

* Fix common Python/Pandas bugs in Jupyter Notebook.

* Use Google to explore additional Pandas functionality as needed.
