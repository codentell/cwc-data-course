# 5.1: Introduction to Matplotlib

## Overview

Today's class will introduce the students to the basics of [Matplotlib](http://Matplotlib.org/), one of the most popular Python plotting libraries in use today. This lesson plan focuses on how to import the Matplotlib library and use its core PyPlot module to design and customize line, bar, and pie charts as well as scatter plots. Today will also serve as a refresher of data visualizations, which were introduced in Unit 1.

### Class Objectives

By the end of today's class, the students will be able to:

* Use Matplotlib's PyPlot interface.

* Create line, bar, and pie charts as well as scatter plots.

* Change the appearance of their plots.

* Identify basic plot configuration options, such as `xlim` and `ylim`.
