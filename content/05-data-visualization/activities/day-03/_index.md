# 5.3: Introduction to Statistics

## Overview

In todayâ€™s class, the students will review the summary statistics that were previously taught in Unit 1, and the implementation of these statistical measures in Python. This lesson also introduces new statistical concepts, such as sample versus population, standard error, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression.

### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, the students will be able to:

* Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, by using Python.

* Plot, characterize, and quantify a normally distributed dataset by using Python.

* Qualitatively and quantitatively identify potential outliers in a dataset.

* Differentiate between a sample and a population in regard to a dataset.

* Define and quantify correlation between two factors.

* Calculate and plot a linear regression in Python.
