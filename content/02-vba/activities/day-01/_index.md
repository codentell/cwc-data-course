## Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson:

* Define building blocks of all programming languages: variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, and functions.
* Create simple VBA macros to trigger pop-ups and change cell values.
* Write VBA subroutines that use variables and conditionals.
* Develop essential coding skills including syntax recollection, pattern recognition, problem decomposition, and debugging.
