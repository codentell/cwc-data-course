In this example, a column of colors is listed.

* A row of color counters uses conditional statements like `COUNTIF`(Colors,"Red") to count the instances of each color.

* A second row of "Above Five" counters use a different conditional statement `(IF(C2>5), "TRUE", "FALSE")` to check if the color count exceeds five for each color.

Note: That in both cases, the cell value is determined by the respective conditional formula, as in the following image:
