# Grade Book


One of the most common uses of Excel in academia is keeping track of students' grades. In this activity, you and your partner will create a spreadsheet that averages out the scores for students in a fictional class and then determines whether each student has passed or failed the course.

## Instructions

The solved should look closely to this: 

![Grade Book Solved](../images/GradeBook_Solved.png)

* Create a formula that calculates the final grade for a student based upon their previous exams and papers.

* When making this calculation:

  * Every paper and exam should be considered equal in weight.

  * Each one should make up 25% of a student's overall grade.

  * Round the result to the nearest whole number, or integer.

* Using conditionals, create a formula that returns `PASS` if a student's final grade is greater than or equal to 60. If the student's final grade is below 60, your formula should return `FAIL`.

## Bonus

* Create a nested `IF()` formula that returns a letter grade based on a student's final grade.

  * Greater than or equal to 90 = `A`
  * Greater than or equal to 80 and less than 90 = `B`
  * Greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80 = `C`
  * Greater than or equal to 60 and less than 70 = `D`
  * Anything less than 60 = `F`

## Hints

* If you need some help with nested `IF()` statements in Excel, check out [Nest Formulas](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/IF-function-%E2%80%93-nested-formulas-and-avoiding-pitfalls-0b22ff44-f149-44ba-aeb5-4ef99da241c8) for more information and helpful tips.

## ‚úÖ Solutions

* The values in the "Pass/Fail" column are determined by a conditional that checks if a student‚Äôs "Final Grade" was greater than or equal to 60. If the statement evaluates to false, then the value is "FAIL." If the statement evaluates to true, then the value is "PASS," as in the following image:

* The values in the "Letter Grade" column are also determined by a conditional, but this conditional is more complex. Whenever a statement evaluates to false in this formula, another conditional is run to check the "Final Grade." Once a statement is found to be true, the corresponding letter grade is placed in the column, as in the following image:

* A recent Excel update added another method to solve a problem like this: the IFS function. This function can be used in place of multiple nested IF functions. It works in the same manner as the nested functions, but it is less bulky. Use of the IFS function is captured in the following image:
