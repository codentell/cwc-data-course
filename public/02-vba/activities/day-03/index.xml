      <description>Star Counter The dataset you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with for this activity contains 50 rows of customer review data for French and Spanish online learning programs. Columns D through H contain the number of stars each program received as feedback. For example, the first row of the data indicates that a French program received two out of five stars in Monnie Mccasland&amp;rsquo;s review.
Data stored this way can be difficult to analyze, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be using VBA to convert it to numerical data.</description>
