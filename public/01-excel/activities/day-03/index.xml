      <description>We will discuss the summary statistics that are used to describe the variability of a dataset.
  variance, standard deviation, and z-score are the summary statistics used to describe the variability in data.
  variance is an overall description of how far values in the dataset are from the mean. In other words, variance describes how much variation exists within the data.
  the equation for variance with the as captured in the following image:</description>

      <description>Wwe are characterizing a dataset, we need to be careful that our summary statistics don&amp;rsquo;t misrepresent the data.
  The biggest challenges in statistics is that real-world data is imperfect. Oftentimes, real-world data will contain extreme values that can skew our interpretations, especially when we try to describe the center of a dataset.
  We use quantiles to describe segments of a dataset.
  quantiles are the &amp;ldquo;cut points&amp;rdquo; that separate a sorted dataset into equal-sized fragments.</description>

      <description>Excel is a fantastic tool for quickly accessing, manipulating, and visualizing small-to-medium-sized datasets. However, Excel does not contain many statistical algorithms or tests &amp;ldquo;out of the box.&amp;rdquo;
  As we progress through the curriculum, we will cover a number of more robust statistical functions, tests, and concepts.
  If we enable Excel&amp;rsquo;s Analysis ToolPak add-on, we can always return to Excel to perform statistical tests on smaller datasets.</description>
