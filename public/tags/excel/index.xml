  Measures of central tendency are some of the most basic concepts in statistics.
  measures of central tendency are values that describe a dataset. More specifically, the measures of central tendency describe the center of a dataset.
  The most common measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode.
  mean of a dataset is also referred to as the arithmetic average of a dataset.</description>

  06-Evr_MeasuringMeasures-CentralTendency/MeasuringMeasures.xlsx
  The measures of central tendency can summarize the dataset using single values, so they are a type of summary statistic. Whenever we analyze a new dataset, we should calculate all three measures of central tendency.
  Depending on the type and size of the dataset, the different measures of central tendency may or may not describe the dataset effectively.
 Therefore, we should always consider what measures of central tendency will summarize the data well before we use them in a summary table.</description>

  variance, standard deviation, and z-score are the summary statistics used to describe the variability in data.
  variance is an overall description of how far values in the dataset are from the mean. In other words, variance describes how much variation exists within the data.

  Powerful tool in the Excel arsenal is the pivot table, which allows users to extract summary data from large, detailed, and consistent datasets.
  Explain that pivot tables summarize data using functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVERAGE on subsets of the data. These subsets can be as general or as specific as we like.

      <description>Wwe are characterizing a dataset, we need to be careful that our summary statistics don&amp;rsquo;t misrepresent the data.
  The biggest challenges in statistics is that real-world data is imperfect. Oftentimes, real-world data will contain extreme values that can skew our interpretations, especially when we try to describe the center of a dataset.
  We use quantiles to describe segments of a dataset.
  quantiles are the &amp;ldquo;cut points&amp;rdquo; that separate a sorted dataset into equal-sized fragments.</description>

      <description>VLOOKUP() takes in four values: a lookup value, the range of a table, the index number for a column within that range, and the match parameter.
  VLOOKUP() searches for a value, it is only looking for matches within the leftmost column of the range that they have selected.
  Since the formula listed specifies 3 as the column index, it will grab the value stored within the third column of the second table.</description>

      <description>Excel is a fantastic tool for quickly accessing, manipulating, and visualizing small-to-medium-sized datasets. However, Excel does not contain many statistical algorithms or tests &amp;ldquo;out of the box.&amp;rdquo;
  As we progress through the curriculum, we will cover a number of more robust statistical functions, tests, and concepts.
  If we enable Excel&amp;rsquo;s Analysis ToolPak add-on, we can always return to Excel to perform statistical tests on smaller datasets.</description>
